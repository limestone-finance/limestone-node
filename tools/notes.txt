Three fields for Primary Key: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32620215/3-fields-composite-primary-key-unique-item-in-dynamodb

=== Proposed structure for prices table ===
= Primary key consists of two attributes:
    - Token: String (token symbol) <- token will be a partition key. It means that data for different tokens will be stored in different partitions 
    - Source#Time: Number (timestamp for price)

= Other attributes:
    - Price: Number
    - Type: String (for example: "data-latest")
    - Version: String (for example: "0.005")
