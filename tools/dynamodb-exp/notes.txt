=== Proposed structure for prices table ===
- Primary key consists of two attributes:
    - Token: String (token symbol) <- token will be a partition key. It means that data for different tokens will be stored in different partitions 
    - Source#Time: String <- Source should be forst for being able to filter by source. Time should be also included in primary key for being able to sort by time
- Other attributes:
    - Price: Number (median of prices from different providers)
    - Type: String (for example: "data-latest")
    - Version: String (for example: "0.005")
    - Prices: String (JSON with prices from different sources)

=== Thoughts ===
- We can use AWS lambda as a DB trigger to automate "latest" price item update
